# 🖼️ Image Card 

This is a simple **JavaScript-based Image Card Project** built as part of a Coding Ninjas challenge.  
It allows users to browse through a set of images using **Prev / Next** buttons with a loader animation.  
Users can also add new images dynamically with a name & URL, which are then previewed for 1 second.
